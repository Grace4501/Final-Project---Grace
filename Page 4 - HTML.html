        <h3>My Hobbies:</h3>
        <p>I have many hobbies that I partake in, but my most active one, is my love for video games. I love games like The Sims, Minecraft and Stardew Valley, which are all used as a calming activity. On the other hand I enjoy games like Skyrim, Borderlands and Dishonored, which are a but more exciting and full of intense moments.</p>
        <p>Here is a much simplier game, but fun never-the-less:</p>

    <div class="Notes">
        <p>Another one of my hobbies, is my love for art, whether that be through playing the guitar, writing a story or drawing. I love all forms of art. Here are a few examples of things I've created:</p>

        <h3>More about Me</h3>
        <p>One of my biggest personality traits, is that I'm a cat person (below is my cat), though I do love all animals, including dogs, hamsters, rabbits and of course donkeys!</p>
